I am an **Associate Professor of Mathematics** at [Christopher Newport University](https://cnu.edu/), where I teach all levels of the mathematics curriculum, from foundational courses to the more specialized courses. I especially enjoy teaching our Calculus and programming courses because these provide a holistic introduction to applied and computational mathematics. I study applications of nonlinear and chaotic dynamical systems. This typically involves combining dynamical systems theory and mathematical programming with applications in quantum mechanics, mathematical ecology, neuroscience, and differential topology.

I also enjoy directing student research projects. Recent collaborations have involved chaotic systems, data science and machine learning, fractals, statistics, and ecology.

## Background

I completed my graduate work at the [University of New Hampshire](https://www.unh.edu/) and my undergraduate studies from [Washington and Lee University](https://wlu.edu/).  I also earned masters degrees at [NC State](https://www.ncsu.edu/) and at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/).  Before all this, I grew up in [rural upstate New York](https://maps.app.goo.gl/syHKz3q6F2bmhPNL6).

In my free time, I like visiting friends and family, traveling and visiting national parks, hiking and backpacking, going to the beach, and just simply be outside.
