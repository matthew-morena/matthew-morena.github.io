abstract: 'In chaos control, one usually seeks to stabilize the unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) that densely inhabit the attractors of many chaotic dynamical systems. These orbits collectively play a significant role in determining the dynamics and properties of chaotic systems and are said to form the skeleton of the associated attractors. While UPOs are insightful tools for analysis, they are naturally unstable and, as such, are difficult to find and computationally expensive to stabilize. An alternative to using UPOs is to approximate them using cupolets. Cupolets, a name derived from chaotic, unstable, periodic, orbit-lets, are a relatively new class of waveforms that represent highly accurate approximations to the UPOs of chaotic systems, but which are generated via a particular control scheme that applies tiny perturbations along Poincaré sections. Originally discovered in an application of secure chaotic communications, cupolets have since gone on to play pivotal roles in a number of theoretical and practical applications. These developments include using cupolets as wavelets for image compression, targeting in dynamical systems, a chaotic analog to quantum entanglement, an abstract reducibility classification, a basis for audio and video compression, and, most recently, their detection in a chaotic neuron model. This review will detail the historical development of cupolets, how they are generated, and their successful integration into theoretical and computational science and will also identify some unanswered questions and future directions for this work.'
