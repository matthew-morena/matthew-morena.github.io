abstract: 'Recent experimental and theoretical work has detected signatures of chaotic behavior in nearly every physical science, including quantum entanglement. In some instances, chaos either plays a significant role or, as an underlying presence, explains perplexing observations. There are certain properties of chaotic systems which are consistently encountered and become focal points of the investigations. For instance, chaotic systems typically admit a dense set of unstable periodic orbits around an attractor. These orbits collectively provide a rich source of qualitative information about the associated system and their abundance has been utilized in a variety of applications.
<br>
<br>
We begin this thesis by describing a control scheme that stabilizes the unstable periodic orbits of chaotic systems and we go on to discuss several properties of these orbits. This technique allows for the creation of thousands of periodic orbits, known as cupolets (Chaotic Unstable Periodic Orbit-lets). We then present several applications of cupolets for investigating chaotic systems. First, we demonstrate an effective technique that combines cupolets with algebraic graph theory in order to transition between their orbits. This also induces certainty into the control of nonlinear systems and effectively provides an efficient algorithm for the steering and targeting of chaotic systems.
<br>
<br>
Next, we establish that many higher-order cupolets are amalgamations of simpler cupolets, possibly through bifurcations. From a sufficiently large set of cupolets, we obtain a hierarchal subset of fundamental cupolets from which other cupolets may be assembled and dynamical invariants approximated. We then construct an independent coordinate system aligned to the local dynamical geometry and that reveals the local stretching and folding dynamics which characterize chaotic behavior. This partitions the dynamical landscape into regions of high or low chaoticity, thereby supporting prediction capabilities.
<br>
<br>
Finally, we demonstrate how interacting chaotic systems may be controlled onto cupolets whose periodic behavior is maintained by their continued interaction. This is known as chaotic entanglement and it evokes a classical analog to quantum entanglement. Fundamental cupolets are believed to play important roles in chaotic entanglement. Based on certain properties of chaotic systems and on examples which we present, there is potential for chaotic entanglement to be naturally occurring.'
