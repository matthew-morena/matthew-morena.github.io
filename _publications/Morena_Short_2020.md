abstract: 'Cupolets are a relatively new class of waveforms that represent highly accurate approximations to the unstable periodic orbits of chaotic systems, and large numbers can be efficiently generated via a control method where small kicks are applied along intersections with a control plane. Cupolets exhibit the interesting property that a given set of controls, periodically repeated, will drive the associated chaotic system onto a uniquely defined cupolet regardless of the system’s initial state. We have previously demonstrated a method for efficiently steering from one cupolet to another using a graph-theoretic analysis of the connections between these orbits. In this paper, we discuss how connections between cupolets can be analyzed to show that complicated cupolets are often composed of combinations of simpler cupolets. Hence, it is possible to distinguish cupolets according to their reducibility: a cupolet is classified either as composite, if its orbit can be decomposed into the orbits of other cupolets or as fundamental, if no such decomposition is possible. In doing so, we demonstrate an algorithm that not only classifies each member of a large collection of cupolets as fundamental or composite, but that also determines a minimal set of fundamental cupolets that can exactly reconstruct the orbit of a given composite cupolet. Furthermore, this work introduces a new way to generate higher-order cupolets simply by adjoining fundamental cupolets via sequences of controlled transitions. This allows for large collections of cupolets to be collapsed onto subsets of fundamental cupolets without losing any dynamical information. We conclude by discussing potential future applications.'
